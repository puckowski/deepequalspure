# NgxDeepEqualsPure

This is a package intended to provide a deep equals function for JavaScript objects without requiring numerous dependencies. Other packages which provide a deep equals function, like Lodash or deep-equal, require a large number of dependencies or they are themselves very large. This contributes to unnecessary bloat and, ultimately, poor application load performance.

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.7.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project NgxDeepEqualsPure` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project NgxDeepEqualsPure`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project NgxDeepEqualsPure` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build NgxDeepEqualsPure` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build NgxDeepEqualsPure`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/ngx-deep-equals-pure` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test NgxDeepEqualsPure` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
